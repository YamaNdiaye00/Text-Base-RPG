You breach the open the ominous door and step in its darkness with caution.
The shadows whisper words in your ear, you do not give into the madness.

You are either brave and righteous or arrogant and incredibly Stupid.
However, it matters not. You are but a mere mortal, and this dungeon will be your tomb.
