Greetings adventurer!
You have made it this far into the peak of Mount Targon!
A final challenge awaits you. Calanthur, Harbringer of Darkness, rests deep within this Dungeon.
To save the World of Riverrun, we must strike him down now while He is regaining his Might.
It is foretold that a mysterious adventurer would vanquish the villain.
Many before you never came back, are you ready to take on this Challenge?
